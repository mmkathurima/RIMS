# Riverside-Irvine Microcontroller Simulator
The Riverside-Irvine Microcontroller Simulator is a software tool that simulates the behavior of microcontrollers for educational and research purposes.

## Features
- Simulation of various microcontroller architectures, including AVR and ARM.
- Support for multiple programming languages, including C and assembly.
- Debugging features such as breakpoints, watchpoints, and step-by-step execution.
- Customizable input/output peripherals, including LEDs, switches, speakers, 7 segment display, and serial communication.
- Graphical user interface for easy simulation setup and control.

# Requirements
The simulator requires the following software to be installed on your system:

### Building
- .NET 6.0
- Microsoft Visual Studio or a similar IDE for C# development
- Windows Media Player Legacy for COM dependencies

### Running
- .NET 6.0 Desktop runtime x86
- Windows Media Player Legacy
- Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable

This software tool currently works on Windows machines (7 and above) where the above dependencies are installed.

# Installation
To install the simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio or another IDE that supports .NET development.
3. Build the project using the IDE's build tools.
4. Run the simulator using the IDE's debugging tools.

# Usage
To use the simulator, follow these steps:

1. Launch the simulator by running the executable file.
2. Load the microcontroller code and simulation configuration.
3. Configure the input/output peripherals as needed.
4. Start the simulation using the Run menu.
5. Use the debugging features to step through the code and observe the behavior of the microcontroller.
